  public:
    // Returns count buildings that can see sunlight
    int countBuildings(vector<int> &height) {
        int cnt=1;
        int maxi = height[0];
        for(int i=1; i<height.size(); i++){
            if(height[i] > maxi){
                cnt++;
                maxi = height[i];
            }
        }
        return cnt;
