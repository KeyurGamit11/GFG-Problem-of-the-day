Input: str = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", k = 25 
Output: true
Explanation: The word contains 26 instances of 'a'. Since only 25 operations are allowed. We can keep 1 instance and change all others to make str a pangram.
#code:
class Solution {
  public:

    bool kPangram(string str, int k) {
       int arr[26] = {0};
       int count =0;
       int opr=0;
       for(int i=0; i<str.size(); i++){
           if(str[i] != ' '){
               arr[str[i]-'a']++;//simply we count alphabet occur ,each one how many time occur
               count++;
           }
       }
       //so we put 1 in arr if that alphabet occur else 0
       for(int i=0; i<26; i++){
           if(arr[i] == 0){ // 0 means that alphabet not present so wo count how many op need
               opr++;
           }
       }
       return (opr <= k) && (count>=26); //count means how many alphabet and op show how many need to make
    }
};
